**qBitrr** is the intelligent glue between qBittorrent and the *Arr ecosystem (Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr). It monitors torrent health, triggers instant imports when downloads complete, automates quality upgrades, manages disk space, integrates with request systems (Overseerr/Ombi), and provides a modern React dashboard for complete visibility and control.

## Why qBitrr?

### The Problem

Managing media downloads across qBittorrent and multiple Arr instances is complex:

- ❌ **Slow imports** - Arr apps check download folders periodically (every 1-5 minutes)
- ❌ **Failed downloads go unnoticed** - Stalled torrents waste indexer hits and bandwidth
- ❌ **Manual intervention required** - Quality upgrades need constant monitoring
- ❌ **Disk space issues** - Downloads fill up storage without warning
- ❌ **Request delays** - Overseerr/Ombi requests wait for manual searching
- ❌ **No visibility** - Difficult to track what's happening across services

### The Solution

qBitrr bridges the gap with intelligent automation:

- ✅ **Instant imports** - Trigger imports immediately when downloads complete (seconds vs. minutes)
- ✅ **Smart health monitoring** - Detect and handle failed/stalled downloads automatically
- ✅ **Quality management** - Search for upgrades based on quality profiles and custom formats
- ✅ **Disk space management** - Pause downloads automatically when space is low
- ✅ **Request prioritization** - Process Overseerr/Ombi requests ahead of regular searches
- ✅ **Complete visibility** - Modern WebUI shows everything in real-time

### Real-World Impact

**Before qBitrr:**
```
1. Overseerr request submitted → waiting
2. Manual search in Radarr → 5 minutes later
3. Torrent downloads → 20 minutes
4. Radarr checks download folder → +2 minutes delay
5. Import begins → +1 minute processing
Total time to library: 28 minutes
```

**With qBitrr:**
```
1. Overseerr request submitted → detected immediately
2. Auto-search triggered → 30 seconds
3. Torrent downloads → 20 minutes
4. qBitrr triggers instant import → +5 seconds
5. Import completes immediately
Total time to library: 20.5 minutes (26% faster)
```
