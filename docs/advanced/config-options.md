# Advanced Configuration Options

## Hidden/Advanced Settings

These configuration options exist but are not generated by `qbitrr --gen-config` because they are intended for advanced troubleshooting only.

### Settings.ProcessSpawnTimeoutSeconds

**Type:** Integer (seconds)
**Default:** 30 seconds
**Added manually to config**

Timeout for spawning Arr instance worker processes during startup.

```toml
[Settings]
ProcessSpawnTimeoutSeconds = 60  # Increase if slow storage
```

**When to adjust:**

- Slow disk I/O (network storage, HDD)
- High system load during startup
- Database on slow filesystem

**Behavior:**

- If process doesn't spawn within timeout, startup fails with error
- Increase if seeing "Process spawn timed out" errors
- Do NOT set below 10 seconds

**Default is usually sufficient** - only adjust if experiencing startup timeouts.

## Edge Case Behaviors

### Infinite Retry Loops

qBitrr uses infinite retry loops in specific scenarios for reliability:

#### 1. Quality Profile Fetching (Startup)

**Location:** `arss.py` lines 6381-6405
**Behavior:** Retries forever until Arr responds with quality profiles

**Retry Strategy:**

- Network errors: Immediate retry
- Server errors: Wait 5 minutes, retry
- Unexpected errors: Give up

**Why:** Quality profiles are required for proper operation. Startup blocks until available.

**Impact:** Startup can hang if Arr is persistently unavailable. Check Arr logs if this occurs.

#### 2. Search Command Posting

**Location:** `arss.py` lines 4351-4366
**Behavior:** Retries search API call until network succeeds

**Retry Strategy:**

- ChunkedEncodingError: Retry immediately
- ContentDecodingError: Retry immediately
- ConnectionError: Retry immediately
- JSONDecodeError: Retry immediately

**Why:** Ensures search commands are never lost due to transient network issues.

**Impact:** Search processing pauses during Arr downtime but resumes automatically when Arr recovers.

**Note:** `Searched=True` only set AFTER successful API call, so failed searches are retried.

## Implementation Details (Not User-Configurable)

### Database WAL Checkpoint

qBitrr automatically performs WAL checkpoint and VACUUM on database errors for self-repair.

**Not configurable** - happens automatically during database error recovery.

See [Database Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/database.md) for details on manual database maintenance.

### TAGLESS Mode Exception

When `Settings.Tagless = true`, qBitrr emulates tags using database entries EXCEPT for the special `qBitrr-ignored` tag, which still uses a real qBittorrent tag.

**Why:** The ignore functionality requires a real tag to prevent qBitrr from processing marked torrents.

**This is intentional design**, not a bug.
